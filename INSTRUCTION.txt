1. Extract all files into one folder. Don't change treemap/sitemap of the folder, it could break the application.
2. Install Python for your system and pip. Add them to the PATH.
3. Open cmd, move to your folder with extracted application and start virtual environment.
- Linux: source venv/bin/active or source venv/bin/activate
- Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate 
4. After you activated your venv (virtual environment) run this command to install dependecies and check if they are installed: pip install -r requirements.txt
5. If everything works well, run the last command to run the application: python app.py
6. Open your browser and go to url http://127.0.0.1:5000
7. Congratulations, now you can check your power of your place for solar panels.
